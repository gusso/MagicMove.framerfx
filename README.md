## Animatable components

As of version 1, **only Frames** are supported. Good news is you can wrap anything in a Frame (such as Text and Stacks) to be able to animate its position around the canvas.

Any component inside a Stack will not animate, but you can press **`‚åò+‚å´`** to unwrap the children and maintain their location before animating.
