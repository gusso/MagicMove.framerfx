# Design interactive animated components. No code.

Magic Move 3 uses the power of Framer's [animation library](https://www.framer.com/api/animation/) to smoothly transition between variants of your design components using user-triggered events and powerful timing controls.

## What's New on 3.0

üö¥‚Äç Connect multiple instances to a single event to cycle or toggle between states.  
ü§∏‚Äç Three types of looping allow you to create fluid continuous animations, like spinners.  
üëØ‚Äç Set staggerred delays to children to simulate natural movement.

## Quick Start

1. Create a design component (**`‚åò+K`**), and at least one instance of it (**`‚åò+D`**).
2. Double click on your instance to change the children's properties you want to animate.
3. Set Magic Move's **`Initial`** state by connecting it to one of your component's instances.
4. Connect to other instances to set the states to be triggered by touch and mouse **`Events`**.
5. Open preview and marvel at your own interactive animated creation üé©üêá

## Supported Components

Animation is restricted to **`Frames`**. You can wrap anything in a Frame (such as Text, Stacks, and any code component) to be able to animate its position, rotation and opacity.

## Events

| Event       | Description                               | Cycle |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Automatic   | On component render.                      |       |
| Tap         | Tapping or clicking the component.        | ‚úÖ    |
| Tap Start   | Touching the component.                   | ‚úÖ    |
| Hover Start | Moving the mouse over the component.      | ‚úÖ    |
| Hover End   | Moving the mouse away from the component. | ‚úÖ    |

| Duration   | **`Tween`** Duration of animation (seconds).                          |
| Easing     | **`Tween`** Predefined or custom b√©zier curve easing function.        |
| Animate    | **`Tween`** Single or continuous animation.                           |
| Repeat     | **`Tween`** Loop, yoyo (reverse easing) or flip the animation.        |

## Timing Options
