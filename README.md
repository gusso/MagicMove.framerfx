# Animate components without using code

1. Create a design component with **`âŒ˜+K`**, and at least one instance of it with **`âŒ˜+D`**.
2. Double click on your instances to change the children's properties you want to animate.
3. Connect Magic Move to one of the instances as its **`Initial`** state, and to any other instances as **`âœ¦ï¸Ž Events`** to be triggered.
4. Preview and be happy forever âœ¨

## Supported Components

Only Frames animate as of right now. However you can wrap anything in a Frame (such as Text and Stacks) to be able to animate its position, rotation and opacity.

Any component inside a Stack will not animate, but you can press **`âŒ˜+âŒ«`** to unwrap the children and maintain their location before creating your animations.
